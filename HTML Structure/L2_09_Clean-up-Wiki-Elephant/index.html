    <p><b>Elephants</b> are mammals of the <a href="/wiki/Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)">family</a> <a
            href="/wiki/Elephantidae" title="Elephantidae">Elephantidae</a> and the largest existing land animals.
        Three <a href="/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a> are currently recognised: the <a

        the <a href="/wiki/African_forest_elephant" title="African forest elephant">African forest
            elephant</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Asian_elephant" title="Asian elephant">Asian
            elephant</a>. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order <a href="/wiki/Proboscidea"
            title="Proboscidea">Proboscidea</a>; extinct members include the <a href="/wiki/Mastodon"
            title="Mastodon">mastodons</a>. The family Elephantidae also contains
        several now-extinct groups, including the <a href="/wiki/Mammoth" title="Mammoth">mammoths</a>
        and <a href="/wiki/Straight-tusked_elephant" title="Straight-tusked elephant">straight-tusked
            elephants</a>. <a href="/wiki/African_elephant" title="African elephant">African
            elephants</a> have larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears,
        and convex or level backs. Distinctive features of all elephants include a long trunk, tusks,
        large ear flaps, massive legs, and tough but sensitive skin. The trunk, also called a <a href="/wiki/Proboscis"
            title="Proboscis">proboscis</a>, is used for breathing, bringing food
        and water to the mouth, and grasping objects. Tusks, which are derived from the incisor teeth,
        serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. The large ear flaps assist in
        maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in communication. The <a href="/wiki/Column"
            title="Column">pillar</a>-like legs carry their great weight.
    </p>
    <p>Elephants are scattered throughout <a href="/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa" title="Sub-Saharan Africa">sub-Saharan

        accessible. They are considered to be <a href="/wiki/Keystone_species" title="Keystone species">keystone

        environments.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>
        Other animals tend to keep their distance from elephants; the exception is their <a href="/wiki/Predator"
            class="mw-redirect" title="Predator">predators</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Lion" title="Lion">lions</a>,

            href="/wiki/African_wild_dog" title="African wild dog">wild dogs</a>, which usually target only young
        elephants (calves).
        Elephants have a <a href="/wiki/Fission%E2%80%93fusion_society" title="Fission–fusion society">fission–fusion
            society</a>, in which multiple family groups
        come together to socialise. Females (cows) tend to live in family groups, which can consist of
        one female with her calves or several related females with offspring. The groups, which do not
        include bulls, are led by the (usually) oldest cow, known as the <a href="/wiki/Matriarchy"
            title="Matriarchy">matriarch</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Males (bulls) leave their family groups when they reach puberty, and may live alone or with other
        males. Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate. They enter a
        state of increased <a href="/wiki/Testosterone" title="Testosterone">testosterone</a> and
        aggression known as <a href="/wiki/Musth" title="Musth">musth</a>, which helps them gain <a
            href="/wiki/Dominance_(ethology)" title="Dominance (ethology)">dominance</a> over other
        males as well as reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups
        and rely on their mothers for as long as three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the
        wild. They communicate by touch, sight, smell, and sound; elephants use <a href="/wiki/Infrasound"

        most mammals. Instead, new teeth grow in at the back of the mouth and move forward to push out
        the old ones. The first chewing tooth on each side of the jaw falls out when the elephant is two
        to three years old. The second set of chewing teeth falls out at four to six years old. The
        third set falls out at 9–15 years of age, and set four lasts until 18–28 years of age. The fifth

        of age and grow continuously at about 17&#160;cm (7&#160;in) a year. A newly developed tusk has
        a smooth <a href="/wiki/Tooth_enamel" title="Tooth enamel">enamel</a> cap that eventually wears
        off. The <a href="/wiki/Dentin" title="Dentin">dentine</a> is known as <a href="/wiki/Ivory"

        Much of the tusk can be seen outside; the rest is in a socket

        water, salt, and roots; debarking or marking trees; and for moving trees and branches when
        clearing a path. When fighting, they are used to attack and defend, and to protect the

    <p>An elephant's skin is generally very tough, at 2.5&#160;cm (1&#160;in) thick on the back and
        parts of the head. The skin around the mouth, <a href="/wiki/Anus" title="Anus">anus</a>, and
        inside of the ear is considerably thinner. Elephants typically have grey skin, but African
        elephants look brown or reddish after wallowing in coloured mud. Asian elephants have some
        patches of depigmentation, particularly on the forehead and ears and the areas around them.
        Calves have brownish or reddish hair, especially on the head and back. As elephants mature,
        their hair darkens and becomes sparser, but dense concentrations of hair and bristles remain on
        the end of the tail as well as the chin, <a href="/wiki/Sex_organ" title="Sex organ">genitals</a> and the
        areas around the eyes and ear openings. Normally the
        skin of an Asian elephant is covered with more hair than its African counterpart.<sup

    <p>The social circle of the female elephant does not necessarily end with the small family unit. In
        the case of elephants in <a href="/wiki/Amboseli_National_Park" title="Amboseli National Park">Amboseli
            National Park</a>, Kenya, a female's life involves
        interaction with other families, clans, and subpopulations. Families may associate and bond with
        each other, forming what are known as bond groups which typically made of two family groups.
        During the dry season, elephant families may cluster together and form another level of social
        organisation known as the clan. Groups within these clans do not form strong bonds, but they
        defend their dry-season ranges against other clans. There are typically nine groups in a clan.
        The Amboseli elephant population is further divided into the "central" and "peripheral"
        subpopulations.<sup id="cite_ref-Sukumar175_92-1" class="reference"><a
                href="#cite_note-Sukumar175-92">&#91;92&#93;</a></sup>

    <p>Some elephant populations in India and Sri Lanka have similar basic social organisations. There
        appear to be cohesive family units and loose aggregations. They have been observed to have
        "nursing units" and "juvenile-care units". In southern India, elephant populations may contain
        family groups, bond groups and possibly clans. Family groups tend to be small, consisting of one
        or two adult females and their offspring. A group containing more than two adult females plus
        offspring is known as a "joint family". Malay elephant populations have even smaller family
        units, and do not have any social organisation higher than a family or bond group.<sup

    <p>The social life of the adult male is very different. As he matures, a male spends more time at
        the edge of his group and associates with outside males or even other families. At Amboseli,
        young males spend over 80% of their time away from their families when they are 14–15. When
        males permanently leave, they either live alone or with other males. The former is typical of
        bulls in dense forests. Asian males are usually solitary, but occasionally form groups of two or
        more individuals; the largest consisted of seven bulls. Larger bull groups consisting of over 10
        members occur only among African bush elephants, the largest of which numbered up to 144

        do not go into musth, while half of those aged 25–35 and all those over 35 do. Young bulls
        appear to enter musth during the dry season (January–May), while older bulls go through it
        during the wet season (June–December). The main characteristic of a bull's musth is a fluid
        secreted from the <a href="/wiki/Temporin" title="Temporin">temporal gland</a> that runs down
        the side of his face. He may urinate with his penis still in his <a href="/wiki/Penile_sheath"
            title="Penile sheath">sheath</a>, which causes the urine to spray on his hind legs.
        Behaviours associated with musth include walking with the head held high and swinging, picking

        over its trunk, which wiggles around and may cause it to trip. By its second week of life, the
        calf can walk more firmly and has more control over its trunk. After its first month, a calf can
        pick up, hold, and put objects in its mouth, but cannot suck water through the trunk and must

        as before until their sixth month, after which they become more independent when feeding. By
        nine months, mouth, trunk and foot coordination is perfected. After a year, a calf's abilities
        to groom, drink, and feed itself are fully developed. It still needs its mother for nutrition
        and protection from predators for at least another year. Suckling bouts tend to last 2–4 min/hr
        for a calf younger than a year and it continues to suckle until it reaches three years of age or

    <p>Touching is an important form of communication among elephants. Individuals greet each other by

        and sex will touch each other's mouths, temporal glands, and genitals, particularly during
        meetings or when excited. This allows individuals to pick up chemical cues. Touching is
        especially important for mother–calf communication. When moving, elephant mothers will touch
        their calves with their trunks or feet when side-by-side or with their tails if the calf is
        behind them. If a calf wants to rest, it will press against its mother's front legs and when it
        wants to suckle, it will touch her breast or leg.<sup id="cite_ref-123" class="reference"><a

        usually bluffing when performing these actions. Excited elephants may raise their trunks.
